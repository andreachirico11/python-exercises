# 0.0.16 16. Kth Value
# Write a program that asks the user for two natural numbers X and K (K > 0). Print out the Kth number (starting from zero not included) number Y that satisfies:
# X + Y == X or Y
# e.g.,
# input: X = 10, K = 1, prints 1
# input: X = 10, K = 2, prints 4
# input: X = 10, K = 3, prints 5
# input: X = 17, K = 1, prints 2
# input: X = 17, K = 2, prints 4
# input: X = 17, K = 3, prints 6
# input: X = 17, K = 4, prints 8
