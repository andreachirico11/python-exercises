'''
Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them, find the numbers that are overlapping. The
primenumbers.txt file has a list of all prime numbers under 1000, and the happynumbers.txt file
has a list of happy numbers up to 1000.
(If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers that canâ€™t be divided by any other number. And yes,
happy numbers are a real thing in mathematics -you can look it up on Wikipedia.
