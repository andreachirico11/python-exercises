# 0.0.15 15. Int to Bits
# Write a program that ask the user for a positive integer number and prints out its bit representation as an array of 0 and 1. The conversion must be done “manually” (i.e., don’t use function bin() or other built-in functions).
# e.g.,
# input: 4, prints [1, 0, 0]
# input: 7, prints [1, 1, 1]
# input: 21, prints [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
